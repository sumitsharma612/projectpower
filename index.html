            Starring Jamie Foxx, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Dominique Fishback
            and Machine Gun Kelly <br> the film throws us into a murky world where
            a new designer drug can, for good or for ill, <br> unlock five minutes
            of latent power in the person taking it. Ivan Moran (Arrival, Ghost
            in <br> the Shell) worked client-side as the shows's overall VFX supervisor,
             while on 400+ <br> shots that took in expertise from the studio's
             concept art, vis dev and VFX teams.<br>
             <br>
             “We found ourselves in a really enviable place with almost a blank
              canvas to explore the <br> drug and its effects,” explains Moran.
               “This meant we could develop the look of the pill <br> itself and
                the changes it makes to the taker’s eyes through to the stylish,
                 jaw-dropping or <br> occasionally flat-out gross end results.
                  We worked really closely with Art <br> Director Jonathan Opgenhaffen
                   from Framestore Pre-production Services for this,<br> concepting
                    each sequence and signature power to give us perspective into
                    how things would work in <br> practise. We also made sure to root
                     the drug’s side effects in actual science - from <br> subatomic
                     vibrational physics theory through to potential innate DNA
                     from animal biology <br> - to not only dazzle the audience but
                     help them suspend their disbelief by giving each <br> power a
                      plausible, real-world backdrop.” <br>
                      <br>
                      With Moran on-set in New Orleans for the shoot, the production
                       and VFX teams worked <br> hand-in-glove in an open creative
                        dialogue to create terrifyingly realistic effects that <br>
                         enhanced the thrilling narrative for each gripping
                         performance.<br>

                       A key sequence sees a full-frame shot of Frank (played by
                        Joseph Gordon-Levitt) staring <br> into the camera as he
                        takes - and survives - a bullet point-blank to the head.
                        The slow- <br>motion sequence was filmed at 800 frames
                       per second, with the camera unflinchingly <br> documenting
                       every skin ripple. Every curl of gunsmoke was meticulously
                       created and <br> simulated in FX, referencing real gun
                       shots filmed at over 70,000 frames per second. <br>
                       “The challenge was to precisely recreate the timing of
                       the ripples and the hair movement <br> from the plate
                       which was achieved on set with a high-velocity blast
                      of air,” says Sita. <br> Referencing an armadillo’s
                      leathery protective shell for the sequence’s distinctive
                      look,<br> the CFX team meticulously sculpted the folds
                      and ripples in CG. The final touch saw the <br> Groom
                        team add full digital hair onto Frank, so as to perfectly
                       time the hair lift and to <br> disguise the constant
                        wind through the actor’s hair from the air gun used on set.

                     <p style="font-size:1.5rem">
                       Art, played by Jamie Foxx, has powers based on vibrational
                      physics and how infrasonic <br> soundwaves interact with physical
                       surfaces and can theoretically change the state of <br> water
                       into plasma - a skillset that saw the Framestore team
                       deep dive into the world of <br> Newtonian fluids and
                       cymatics for inspiration. “Art’s powers were fascinating
                       to research <br> and the patterns we uncovered are truly
                       beautiful,” says Opgenhaffen. The results might <br> be
                         beautiful, but they are also devastating, with Art
                       unleashing a huge destructive blast <br> that put Framestore’s
                       creatives through their paces. “Art’s power sequence is
                        easily the <br> most challenging sequence I have ever attempted
                       to devise, plan and film in my career,” <br> says Moran of this
                      deceptively complex sequence. “The shots were filmed
                       night, on <br> location, in rain, at extremely high camera
                       speeds which was immensely challenging <br> given the lack
                       of light. Many background details were added in VFX
                       so that we could <br> warp and distort them to show the shockwave
                        exploding away from Art.” While the force <br> of Art’s power
                         rather speaks for itself, the team also created CG
                         smoke, fire, steam and <br> vapor of the aftermath, as
                         well as building out the environment with a huge number
                         of <br> shipping containers. “The lengths we went to achieving
                          as much as possible in camera <br> are truly extraordinary and
                         complemented by devastatingly impressive VFX work,” <br>
                         concludes Moran.

                       One of Project Power’s most eye-catching sequences involves
                       Newt - better known as <br> rapper Machine Gun Kelly -
                       boiling at a subatomic level and transforming the air
                       around <br> him into pure fire via a phenomenon known as
                       superheated steam as he grapples Art.<br> “Not only did
                       this involve overcoming the perennial film-making challenge
                       of convincingly <br> setting a cast member on fire, but the
                       sequence took place over 100 shots, in nine <br> different
                       locations and culminates with the characters being dunked
                       underwater,” <br> explains Twyford. With fire being a famously
                       difficult light source, Moran struck upon an <br> innovative
                       solution to ensure the fight could be as realistic as possible.
                       Working closely <br> with the on-set prosthetics and electric team,
                       Moran developed fully-programmed strips <br> of flickering LED
                       lights which were applied as a layer to the actor’s body
                        encased in the <br> many fine layers of  a head-to-toe prosthetic
                        suit. "The process took up to eight hours to <br> install and
                        MGK chose to wear it three days in a row to not have to
                        go through it twice,” <br> recalls Moran. “As well as providing
                         a flickering, fire-like light source on the actor, the <br>
                         suit also illuminated walls and objects as he ran past
                         them and Art, as MGK grappled <br> with Jamie on set for true
                         believability. We also had a stunt actor - actually on fire
                         this <br> time - recreate the scene to provide real-life
                         reference.”

                         Frozen Girl, played by Jazzy De Lisser, sees her body
                         transform into ice. Shot in one <br> single two-minute take
                         comprising some 2,000 frames, this sequence posed a major <br>
                         challenge for the VFX team. “The amount of detail in that
                         shot is incredible,” says <br> Moran. “Jazzy is constantly
                        moving, trying to escape from a circular tank while ice <br>
                        crystals grow over her skin and her breath fogs the glass.”
                        The startling sequence took <br> some nine months to realise in
                        total. Sita explains, “body-tracking worked with rigging
                        to <br> preserve Jazzy’s performance, while our FX team drove
                        a tremendous amount of texture <br> work. We had to remove the
                        reflections of the camera crew from the glass while also <br>
                        matching the multiple flashing light sources from the room
                        outside the tank. We played <br> the shot in realtime and every
                        single frame had 70 lights that needed to be manually art <br>
                        directed, colored, calibrated and matched from camera
                        references so that all ice on her <br> body could properly interact
                        with her skin. This level of detail might seem intense,
                        but it <br> means you achieve a level of realism that keeps you
                        locked into the spectacle and puts <br> the spotlight on the
                        actor’s performance.”

                        One of the sequences sees the chameleonic Camo Guy
                        (Cory DeMeyers) robbing a <br> bank - but as his stress
                        increases, so does his lack of control over his temporary <br>
                        abilities. Camo Guy’s powers were inspired by the humble
                        cuttlefish, which has the <br> ability to mimic its surroundings.
                        “This dynamic strobing effect was created from skin <br> shader
                        passes, and compositing artists were key in driving the
                        look and feel of Camo <br> Guy’s escapade, selecting elements
                        from his environment that stuck to his body,” <br> explains
                        CG Supervisor Kevin Sears. “It was a truly collaborative
                        experience, with <br> Framestore’s matchmove team working on
                        body control data and lookdev artists adding <br> skin and
                        sweat details that get a reflected sheen on his skin.” <br>
                        <br>
                        Sita explains, “the work on the character was tested
                        before main photography as a 2D <br> based look which proved
                        that Camo Guy would have an interesting effect, but lacked <br>
                        some of the lighting and more dynamic patterns in its cells.
                        We called on FX and lookdev <br> to achieve that additional
                        motion and subsurface look with the texture and reflections <br>
                        embedded in his body in compositing. We matched the plate
                        for lighting and adjusted his <br> skin wetness and specularity
                        to get a more interesting shape.” <br>

                      <p style="font-size:1.5rem">
                        Biggie’s superpower (Rodrigo Santoro) sees him almost
                        double in size, transforming into <br> an imposing, asymmetrical
                        beast-like figure that towers over his surroundings.
                        “The <br> plates were shot in a miniature set,” explains Sita.
                        “This helped us work out how big the <br> actor should be,
                        and how he’d be interacting in an environment where he
                        looks much br taller.” Working with these plates, Framestore’s
                        tracking and CFX teams performed detailed plate augmentations
                        as they matched Biggie’s on-set prosthetics with a series
                        of CG body parts and muscle jiggles. The FX team created
                        gruesome tumors and intricate veins under his skin,
                        deforming Biggie’s face to one side to finalize the
                        grotesque transformation.

                        The team began by designing the pill, including the
                        drug’s reactive eye effect — a key <br> indicator that the
                        character had succumbed to its superpowers. Framestore’s
                        vis dev <br> team rebuilt the human eye with its intricate iris
                        strands and blood vessels using fluid <br> dynamics and volumes,
                        and airdropped it to circumvent the traditional VFX
                        pipeline. “The <br> challenge was to make it look like it’s
                        freezing in a way that isn’t terrifying — it was <br> massively
                        complicated and looks stunning,” beams Twyford. Throughout
                        the whole <br> process,  vis dev had a key role in establishing
                        the look and the steps the characters <br> would go through. For
                        Frozen Girl, from the initial concept of the sequence to
                        the last <br> iterations with the character fully frozen, vis
                        dev went through various looks that ranged <br> from real and
                        gruesome (involving frostbite and peeling skin) to a death
                        that was still <br> gruesome but far more ‘elegant’, and more
                        reliant on both the ice FX and the actor’s <br> performance.
                        “It was incredible to see the collaborative process, with
                        departments <br> spurring each other on in order to achieve an
                        amazing final look,” concludes Sita.<br>
